# project0

This project is meant to serve as a guide for my future web developments.

It follows a microservice architecture.

It will be deployed in an old laptop in my apartment.

It is composed of:

nginx: Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate service.

frontend-service: Frontend web-client built on Next.js using TypeScript.

inventory-service: A basic service that manages a list of named items. Its built on Express.js

(and many other services in the future.)
