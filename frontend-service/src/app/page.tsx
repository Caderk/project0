      <p>
        This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase personal projects and demonstrate proficiency in modern web development technologies. It features a responsive frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, it interacts with multiple backend services, and is fully containerized using Docker.
        
        I&apos;m currently working on the layout, palettes, and UX design of the site.
