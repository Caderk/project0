      <p>
        This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase
        personal projects, demonstrate proficiency in modern web development
        technologies, and for my own experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It features a responsive frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, it
        interacts with multiple backend services, and is fully containerized
        using Docker.
      </p>
      <p>The overall design of the site is still in development.</p>
